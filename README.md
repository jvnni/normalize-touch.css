# Normalize Touch

A version of normalize with some tweaks made for touch-webkit web apps on iOS and Android devices. Specially customized for development of mixed native/web apps using frameworks such as Cordova/Phonegap.

All the <em>ie</em> stuff has been wiped out.

It includes a <strong>css</strong>, <strong>scss</strong> and <strong>less</strong> version of the file.

Webkit-touch tweaks by me, jota-v.
